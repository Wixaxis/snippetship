## SNIPPETSHIP

This project is an early version of an app, that someday is going to be a must have tool for teams of developers of any size and level of experience!

It's going to allow sharing, grouping and fast selection of most used cli commands available for any tech-stack

As a developer, you must have forgotten "that cli command to do this particular thing" at least a dozen times. Thanks to snippetship, that would become a thing from the past! With this app, teams will be able to segregate the most used commands into groups by their purpose, share them with other team members and even build communities around tools and their most common usages. A future CLI program will let you choose common commands related to your current project with a simple menu :D
